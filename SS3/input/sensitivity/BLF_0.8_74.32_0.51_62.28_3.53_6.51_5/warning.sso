Warning 1 : 2 catch records have been accumulated into year, seas, fleet 2015 1 1; total catch= 1115.86
Note 1 Information: Max data length bin: 99  < max pop len bins: 124; so will accumulate larger pop len bins
Warning 2 : Fleet:_1min bound on parameter for size at peak is 15.57; which is < min databin (33), so illogical.
Warning 3 : Setting in starter does not request all priors, and 3 parameters have priors and are not estimated, so their prior not included in obj_fun.
Warning 4 : Minimum pop size bin:_4; is > L at Amin for sex: 1; Gpat: 1; L= 0
Warning 5 : Minimum pop size bin:_4; is > L at Amin for sex: 2; Gpat: 1; L= 0
Note 2 Information: A revised protocol for the Fcast_yr specification is available and recommended.
Note 3 Information:  N parameters that are on or within 1% of min-max bound: 1; check results, variance may be suspect
